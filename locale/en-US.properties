revealFilePaths_title=Reveal selected file paths to scripts

If you are not concerned with the privacy of your file paths, you can enable this option (e.g., so that your file viewing program can display the current path for you).
displayErrors_title=Display errors
displayErrors_description=When the selected file does not find a handler according to your configuration, display the errors.
