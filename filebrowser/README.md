# filebrowser

This is a replacement for [filebrowser-enhanced](https://github.com/brettz9/filebrowser-enhanced).

The goal is to offer desirable features as a replacement for the built-in file
browser, and to interoperate well with WebAppFind, AtYourCommand, AsYouWish, and
ExecutableBuilder.

## To-dos

- Incorporate from [filebrowser-enhanced](https://github.com/brettz9/filebrowser-enhanced).
