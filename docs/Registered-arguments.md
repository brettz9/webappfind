# Registered arguments

This page is for tracking well-known argument properties of a format that can
be leveraged across applications.

Arguments may be used for passing configuration such as theme, without needing

Arguments are distinct from modes (which represents a special mode into which
the file is being opened, such as viewing source code, and which should be
mutually exclusive with other modes).
